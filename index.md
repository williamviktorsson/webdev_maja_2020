# Assignment 1

In this first assignment you'll be practicing git, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Complete the following steps:

0. Finish the  [interactive webpages tutorial](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js) at Khan Academy.

1. Open your terminal, navigate to the same folder where you have your webdevpriv and webdevpub repositories using the ``cd`` command. If you do not have a GitHub account or these repositories, follow [these steps from earlier this year](assignment_1/webdev.pdf), performing all steps up to and including GitHub.

2. Clone the git repository to your computer using the following command line snippet:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wilvik05/webdev_maja_2020.git
    ```

3. [The result of your code will be viewable here](assignment_1). Start by taking a look.
    - You'll be adding to a **.js** file that has a randomized name you've been provided earlier.
    - The code you write will add and change content under a specific section of the website that has your name on it.
    - You also have a **.css** file in your name to make css changes in, should you not wish to make them all in code.

4. You are tasked to add the following items and functionality under your randomized name.
    - Add any geometric object of any color distinguishable from the background. You're allowed to make something more exciting than a simple geometric volume as well.
    - Add a button that visually changes the previously added object when pressed.
    - Add another geometrical object that periodically and automagically changes while viewing it.
    - Add a slideshow with images of your chosing.
    - All added content must be safe for work.

5. The VSCode extension `Live Server` is great for viewing the results of your changes as you are writing them.
    - Go to the extensions panel on the left of VSCode.
    - Search and download **Live Server**
    - To run: `CTRL + SHIFT + P` in VSCode and write `Live Server`
        - Choose `Live Server: Open with Live Sever`

6. You'll need a few git operations to add your changes to the remote repository.
    - ``git add .``
    - ``git commit -am "finished assignment"``
    - ``git pull``
    - ``git push``
    - You may want to [look at this cheat-sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) for guidance.

7. Wait about a minute or ask for help with any git related issues. Then [view the results of your efforts here](assignment_1).

8. If you want to make other parts of the page more visually pleasing without sabotaging with other students work, you may do so.

# Examination

1. Follow the instructions on goole classroom.

2. You may use the [provided code for navigation](examination_webdev) freely.
